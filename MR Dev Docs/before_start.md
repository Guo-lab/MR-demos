- ### [visionOS Fundamentals - Watch before you build for Vision Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-mIIcvYrh0)
  Windows and Volumes live in the spaces(type: [Shared] and [Full])

  - RealityKit √
  - Unity (Polyspatial tanslation) √
      These two [comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHy6FFQHasc) at 2:07
      -
  - SwiftUI √
  - UIKit

  Tools

  - Xcode -> visionOS simulator
  - App   -> Reality Composer Pro(building 3D scenes)
  - Unity -> build 3D experiences

  Notes: Apps get events.

  Q & A:

  - compatible with iPad or iPhone?
  - Apple System components as many as possible?

    - Apple Framework:
        > Xcode
        SwiftUI previews, simulators and instruments
        Reality Composer Pro -> 3D content preparation - ecosystem

    - Unity
        > PolySpatial (Immersive) + RealityKit(Apple)
        Only Unity: XR Interaction Toolkit (Fully Immersive) - cross-platform
